NU Bootcamp Full-Stack May 2018 Cohort Final Project

Most consumers are aware of or have used the application IMDB, which has become so widely used that it was purchased by Amazon. Any visitor (among, according to its own website, over 250 million unique monthly users) can use the application to search for movies, tv shows, and other media properties, as well as for cast and crew profiles. It also functions like a LinkedIn profile for these entertainment professionals, allowing them to curate their personae with photos, biographical details, and other information for fans (and, presumably, for other industry professionals).

No such application exists for film students, faculty, or the universities at which they complete their programs, at least not on a large scale. The application will potentially benefit thousands of users at well over 100 college and university film and media programs across the U.S. alone.

The purpose of this project is to deploy a MERN-stack application for three interrelated user groups: film school students (and alumni), faculty, and university administrators. 

The user experience is threefold:

There is, essentially, no way to verify the work of aspiring professionals, other than their demo reels. For current undergraduate and graduate film students, the user interface will allow them to create a profile containing biographical, academic, and professional details, including their expected degree, field of study, and any cast/crew roles they have filled during their programs. The profile will also display an embedded video link to the student's demo reel (most of these are housed on YouTube or, more commonly, Vimeo).

Students assembling teams for their own projects also generally have no "central casting" service. The application will allow users to search for available talent, filtering by location, expertise, and other qualifiers. Example: a producer or director may search for "director of photography" and find a dozen fellow students qualified to fit that role. A similar search combined with "Chicago" will yield results from schools like DePaul, UIC, Columbia College, Northwestern, and others.

Producers can also post projects they are looking to fill, with dates and available roles; users can search or browse projects and indicate their interest, which will alert the producer, or through direct inbox contact.

Faculty can also create profiles, which may include expertise, courses taught, notable alumni, and any professional work, awards, or recognition.

The third critical user group is the school program itself. The school user (a program administrator) will create and manage the school's profile, to include degree programs offered, courses taught, available facilities and equipment, faculty, notable alumni, current rankings, contact information for the program administrator, etc. The other prominent role of the program administrator will be to verify student participation in their programs when indicated by a student creating a profile. Once a school registers as a user, the school program will appear in a drop-down menu for students to select when creating a profile. On submitting the profile, the program administrator will receive an alert that a student has registered, and a prompt to visit the site to confirm the student's participation in the school program. This will act like a "verified" status marker on a student profile, much like a "verified" celebrity Twitter account.

All parties stand to benefit from high volume usage: 

- Film students will gain increased visibility within their home school and in their current city (i.e., there's no reason for a Radio-TV-Film major at Northwestern University not to get noticed by a production team at DePaul's School of Cinematic Arts, etc).
- Film school faculty will gain exposure among current and potential students, as well as the general public.
- Programs will gain increased visibility among potential students. High school students will use the application to compare school offerings, learn about notable alumni, and view current student work.
